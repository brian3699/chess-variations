OOGA Chess Variations
====

## Project Overview 

This project implements 6 variations of chess.

Names: Young Jun, Margaret Sullivan, Nayla Boorady, Luke Turkovich, Carson Calahan, Evelyn Cupil-Garcia

I have worked mainly on frontend and controllers. I have significantly contributed to the general design of the project - the roles of controllers and how backend and frontend should interact. 

The frontend classes (all classes in the view package) are well refactored and closely follow the OOP principles. These classes are also versatile and extendable and could be easily used in other projects to create different chess variations.

A user can choose to play 6 variations of chess in three different languages (English, Spanish, Korean). A user can also play multiple games at once.
